// 1 - Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns the same string in all capital letters followed by all lowercase letters.
var stringOne = "MoBIuS"
function upperLower(stringOne) {
    
}


// 2 - Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns a number that is half the string's length, rounded down.
//Hint: You'll need to use Math.floor().



// 3 - Write a function that uses slice() and the other functions you've written to return the first half of the given string.



// 4 - Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns that string where the first half is capitalized, and the second half is lowercase.
//Hint: If your string length is odd, use Math.floor() to round down.



// 5 - Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and capitalizes any character that follows a space.
//(This one is a step up in difficulty and utilizes the .split() string method and .join() array method):
