          <p class="article-line-height">
            Our name is pretty much the only explanation required, but just in case, I'll do a quick review of our services. We sell swords to lords <span class="italic">exclusively</span>. If you are not a lord, and would like to buy a sword, there is a very little known shop next door called "Swords for Sad Peasants." Basic, we know. fortunately, we've made it clear that we only sell swords to lords so you shouldn't be surprised and there isn't much for you to complain about... Aside from not being a lord.

            <span class="bold">Answer</span>: Abolutely not! Would we be able to call ourselves "<span class="italic">Swords for Lords</span>" if we sold a sword to someone who wasn't a lord!? ...Unless you're armed, of course.

            This is the sword for a hero, a hero of times present and times past. A hero who rises again and again and prevents calamitous disaster. If you fancy yourself a young, reckless, and yet completely loved and essential knight of justice; this is the sword for you. Main points in its favor are that it is very good at vanquishing evil, providing light, and breaking pottery.

            This sword is for those of you fighting for your life. Some people think this is a game, others... Well, they understand what death means and fight against it to their very last breath, and beyond. If you intend to stay alive until you win, this is the sword for you. Points in its favor are; it is a very rare and powerful beast of a magical artifact, with as of yet unknown properties (every swing is a mystery!), it collects experience like it was made for it, and it looks very classy.

            This sword is for any person, human or otherwise, who does not want to let a zombie ruin their run. Additionally, anything creepy looking better stay away. This sword is made of materials which are found deep underground and often near lava, very dangerous to collect. You will need a stocky build to weild it. Points in its favor are; it swings very fast and breaks half as often of a similar sword made of steel.
